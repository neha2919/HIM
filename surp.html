            The manifestation without forgery<br>
            Is akin to that of a God<br>
            The calmness within mind<br>
            Is still an irony<br>
            None the less<br>
            The world we create<br>
            Is still a fools dream<br>
        </div>

        <!-- Block for poem 2 -->
        <div>
            Hairs like a golden fleece<br>
            Smile like moonlight<br>
            Eyes as deep as the ocean<br>
            An autonomous lookalike<br>
        </div>
        <div>
            Beneath the sky without stars<br>
            I was left all alone<br>
            Waiting for her<br>
            Trying to let go<br>
            She said it was fine<br>
            But in the end<br>
            It was a deathball game
        </div>
        <div>
            The winds has no stir<br>
            The skies were dark<br>
            The sound of eeriness is what echoed<br>
            Are you still alive?<br>
            "Isn't it enough, just let me be alive"
        </div>
        <div>
            Incandescent is what you call love<br>
            Marvellous is what despises hurdles<br>
            A vintage is what we hold on to<br>
            And belief is the epitome of it all
        </div>
        <div>
            Amidst the chaos<br>
            Embrace the calm<br>
            Forget the dark<br>
            Ignite the spark<br>
            Clasp the warmth<br>
            And humor the light<br>
            Who knows that would ease the night
        </div>
        <div>
            The wind ushered away<br>
            The excitment one imprisons<br>
            The gloomy sku poured<br>
            The hue isolated<br>
            The domain of darkness<br>
            Conquers the light<br>
            There is no such thing as true and fairness in sight
        </div>
        <div>
            The death bell ringing<br>
            The darkness visible<br>
            The crows conceal the sky<br>
            The shadows limited in scope<br>
            The sighting was grey<br>
            The vision limited<br>
            And yet there was a light<br>
            Seen afar
